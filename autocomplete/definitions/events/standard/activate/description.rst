This event is invoked whenever something is activated, typically by the player. Activation is usually done with the associated activate/use key, but may also be forced by scripts.

Non-player actors may also activate objects, such as when opening doors, or via MWSE functions like `xActivate`_ or ``tes3.activate()``.

Some examples of when the activate event fires includes:

- When a door is used.
- When an item is picked up.
- When someone attempts to open a container.

.. note:: See the `Event Guide`_ for more information on event data, return values, and filters.
