xMyCellID
========================================================

**Parameters:**

- **None**

**Returned:**

- ``string`` **cellID**: The reference's current cell ID.

Returns a string containing the name of the cell the object (intended to be used with references to unique NPCs) inhabits. So fargoth_ref->xMyCellID would return "Seyda Neen" unless you've lured him into the wilderness for some reason. Useful for locating that missing companion. Can't locate items stored in containers or inventory.
