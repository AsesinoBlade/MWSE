xSetLevel
========================================================

**Parameters:**

- ``long`` **level**:  New value to set the reference's level to.

Sets the level of the given reference. This function is a wrapper for SetLevel,
and suffers from the same display issue: when using this function on the
player, the character screen does not update with the new level.
