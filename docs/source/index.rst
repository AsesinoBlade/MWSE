Morrowind Script Extender v2
========================================================

The Morrowind Script Extender makes additional functions available for use in Morrowind scripts, beyond those provided by the game's construction set.

These extra functions allow modders to add features and behavior to scripts that would otherwise be impractical or impossible.

.. important:: The latest version of MWSE can be downloaded either from the `GitHub release page <https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE/releases>`_ or the `Nexus mod page <https://rd.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45468>`_. If you're looking for MWSE scripting advice or discussions, try the `Morrowind Modding Community Discord <https://discord.gg/QDEBbaP>`_
