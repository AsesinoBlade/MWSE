# spellTick

The spellTick event happens every frame that an effect is active on a target. This can be used to aid in scripted spells, cancel active spells, or otherwise monitor spell activity on actors.

```lua
--- @param e spellTickEventData
local function spellTickCallback(e)
end
event.register("spellTick", spellTickCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`source`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
