!!! example "Example: Notify the player that their arrow/bolt killed their opponent"

	```lua
	
	-- Print a message if player's arrow killed its target
	local function onDamaged(e)
	    -- We only care if the player did the damage
	    if e.attackerReference ~= tes3.player then
	        return
	    end
	
	    -- Check if the damage was caused by a projectile, but not by a spell, so it must be an arrow or a bolt
