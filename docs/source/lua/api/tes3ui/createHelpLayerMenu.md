# createHelpLayerMenu

Creates a help layer menu. Help layer menus include notifications and tooltips that are always above the rest of the interface. The game realizes this using a separate menu root and set of functions.

Note, to create tooltips with the correct behaviour, use tes3ui.createTooltipMenu.

Unlike standard menus, help layer menus are always created with a fixed frame.
